                                EZDFFTPACK V1.0                                
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A collection of wrappers by Jason L. Turner for DFFTPACK V1.0. DFFTPACK itself,
created by Hugh C. Pumphrey, is a double precision clone of FFTPACK V4 by Paul
N. Swarztrauber. DFFTPACK and FFTPACK are both available at

    https://www.netlib.org/fftpack/

This repository contains a complete copy of the FORTRAN sources of DFFTPACK, as
well as

(*) A Makefile which I have modified to work on some modern Linux and Windows
machines using the compiler gfortran (updated from g77).

(*) A file doc which was supplied with DFFTPACK and has been reformatted and
altered to reflect the additional subroutines.

(*) A file doc.ez which details the additional files I have added.

The original FFTPACK and DFFTPACK were public domain, so EZDFFTPACK is also
public domain. It is released in the hope that it will be useful, although
there is no warranty of any sort covering this software.

Below are the contents of this file included with DFFTPACK:

*****************************************************************
        A Double precision clone by Hugh C. Pumphrey  of:
                      FFTPACK
               version 4  april 1985

The gzipped tar file dp.tgz contains a complete copy of the FORTRAN
sources of fftpack, with everything converted to double precision. If
you do 

gunzip dp.tgz
tar xvf dfftpack.tar 

You will get a directory called dfftpack with all the source code in
it. There is also:

(*) a Makefile which I have tweaked to work on modern Linux and Solaris
systems. The comments in this file document the changes made.

(*) a file doc which was supplied with fftpack and which has been 
altered to reflect the changes made in the change to double precision.

(*) A file doc.double which details the changes I made to the source code

Please send any comments or bug reports to hcp@met.ed.ac.uk . Please
also report if you get dfftpack to build successfully on any system
other than Linux or Solaris. 

The original FFTPACK was public domain, so dfftpack is public domain
too. It is released in the hope it will be useful to someone. There is 
no warranty of any sort covering this software.
